# Grover-Enhancer

Our project focuses on optimizing the training model of the already developed NLP network, Grover, to increase its accuracy in recognizing examples of fake news in the hopes of preventing the widespread transmission of fallacious news content.

To approach this, we propose manipulating the coefficients of the connecting edges of the hidden layers to better calibrate the network for any commonalities between human written facts to machine written fake news. With our limited resources, we are hoping to test our model on generated articles from other AI models like ChatGPT and Rytr. 

In our initial tests, Grover experienced issues in recognizing clearly falsified articles generated by superior AI models. Our approach aims to minimize the reccurence of this phenomenon.
